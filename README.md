# Booths-Algorithm

Booth's Algorithm implementation for a course project for course:Computer Organisation. It was one of 2 projects done for this course.

* Multiplication.cpp implements multiplication for integers like it in done on the circuit level

* Division.cpp implements division for integers like it in done on the circuit level

* Design Documentation explains the flow of the 2 programs along with complexity analysis

## Run 
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 multiplication.cpp -o multiplication
g++ -std=c++11 division.cpp -o division
./multiplication #To run multiplication
./division #To run division
```
